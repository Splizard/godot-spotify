This is just an experimental project to use grow.graphics/gd 

Follow the installation for that and you should be able to simply run `gd` to build and start the project. This repo comes with a proof of concept godot project but I think the resulting `graphics/library.gdextension` and corresponding DLL, SO or dylib file should work if copied over to any other godot project.
